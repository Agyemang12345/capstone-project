# ⏳ INSTALLING - THEN TRAINING

Your requirements are being installed right now!

## What's happening:
✅ pip is downloading and installing all packages
✅ TensorFlow, Keras, OpenCV, and 35+ other packages
✅ Should complete in 5-15 minutes

## After installation completes, run this command:

```powershell
python simple_train.py
```

This will:
1. Load your dataset from `data/dataset/Train/Train/`
2. Train MobileNetV2 model for 20 epochs
3. Save the model as `plant_disease_model.h5`
4. Generate training graphs
5. Show you the accuracy

## Estimated timeline:
- Installation: 5-15 minutes
- Training: 10-20 minutes
- **Total: 20-35 minutes to first working model**

---

**Just wait for pip to finish, then run: `python simple_train.py`**
